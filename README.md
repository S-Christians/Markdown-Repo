# Hello, welcome to my travel bucket list!

This repository will detail my travel bucket list, including information for the countries that I hope to travel to in the near future. Each page includes, basic knowledge (currency, official language, capital, etc.), travel requirements, fun facts, and imagery for each. 

I think this repository is useful for both myself and others because it has information that may help people decide where they would like t0 travel in the future. Right now it only contains four islands, but in the future I would like to expand to including all the countries in the world (or at least my favorites).
## My Travel Bucket List (in order)
